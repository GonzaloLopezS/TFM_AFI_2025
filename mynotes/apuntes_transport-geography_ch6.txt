# 6. Transportation terminals
# 6.1 Function of Transport terminals

    A terminal is a facility where passengers and freight are assembled or dispersed during transportation.

Freight must be consolidated at a distribution center, a port, or a rail yard before shipment. 

Terminal. Any location where freight and passengers either originate, terminate, or are handled in the transportation process. Terminals are central 
and intermediate locations in the mobility of passengers and freight. They often require specific facilities and equipment to accommodate the traffic 
they handle.

One core attribute of transport terminals is their convergence function. They are obligatory points of passage, capitalizing on their geographical 
location, which is generally intermediate to commercial flows. Thus, transport terminals are created by centrality or intermediacy processes involving 
the locations they are connected to.

The importance of a transport terminal is often a function of its size. Large transport terminals, particularly ports and airports, confer the status 
of gateway or hub to their location since they become obligatory points of transit between different segments of the global transport system. 
Containerization has favored the emergence of a hierarchy of terminals fulfilling different functions and added value, from the mega-gateway 
coordinating the flows of a large market area to a small rail yard or truck depot servicing a local market.

## 2. Importance and Performance:
Location. The major locational factor of a transport terminal is obviously to serve a large concentration of economic activities, representing a 
terminal’s market area. Specific terminals have specific locational constraints, such as port and airport sites. The former requires a suitable 
coastline and nautical profile, while the latter requires a large footprint of open flat land. New transport terminals tend to be located outside 
central areas to avoid high land costs and congestion and find available land.

The time a conveyance (bus, truck, train, or ship) is allowed to load or unload passengers or freight at a terminal is usually defined as dwell time.
For freight terminals as dwell time refers to when cargo stays in a terminal yard or storage area while waiting to be loaded.

## 4. Freight Terminals:
A basic distinction concerns bulk, general cargo, and containers:

    Bulk refers to goods handled in large quantities that are unpackaged and available in uniform dimensions. Liquid bulk goods include crude oil and 
    refined products that can be handled using pumps to move the product along with hoses and pipes. Relatively limited handling equipment is needed, 
    but significant storage facilities may be required. Dry bulk includes a wide range of products, such as ores, coal, and cereals. More equipment for 
    dry bulk handling is needed, because the material may have to utilize specialized grabs and cranes and conveyor-belt systems. For specific bulk 
    cargoes, some changes in their characteristics may be required to ensure the continuity of the transportation process, such as its load unit or its 
    physical state (from solid to liquid or gas, or any combination).

    General cargo refers to goods of many shapes, dimensions, and weights, such as machinery, processed materials, and parts. Because the goods are so 
    uneven and irregular, handling is difficult to mechanize. General cargo handling usually requires labor.

    Containers are standard units that have had a substantial impact on terminal operations. Container terminals have minimal labor requirements and 
    perform a wide variety of intermodal functions. They, however, require a significant amount of storage space, which are simple paved areas where 
    containers can be stacked and retrieved with intermodal equipment (cranes, straddlers, and holsters). Depending on the intermodal function of the 
    container terminal, specialized cranes, such as portainers (container cranes), are required.

Measurement of freight traffic through terminals is more complicated than for passengers. Because freight is so diverse, standard measures of weight 
and value are difficult to compare and combine. Because bulk cargoes are inevitably weighty, terminals specialized in such cargoes will record higher 
throughput measured in tons than others more specialized in general cargoes. This is evident in the world’s two leading ports, Singapore and Rotterdam, 
handling large quantities of petroleum. The reverse may be true if the value of commodities handled is the measure employed. The problem of measurement 
involving weight or volumes becomes very difficult when many types of freight are handled because one is adding together goods that are inherently 
unequal. Interpreting the significance of freight traffic totals is thus subject to caution. For container terminals, a common measure of productivity 
concerns the number of lifts per container gantry crane-hour, which are usually 25-40 moves per hour for quay cranes and 40-60 for rail cranes.

The difficulty of comparing traffic totals of different commodities has led to attempts to weigh cargoes based on some indication of the value-added 
they contribute to the terminal.
The most famous is the “Bremen Rule” developed in 1982 by the port of Bremen and based on a survey of the labor cost incurred in handling one ton of 
different cargoes.
The results found that handling one ton of general cargo equals three tons of dry bulk and 12 tons of liquid bulk.

Although this is the most widely used method, other rules have been developed by individual ports, such as the Antwerp and Rotterdam Rules. The 
“Antwerp Rule” indicates that the highest value-added is fruit handling. Using this benchmark, forest product handling requires 3.0 tons to provide 
the same value-added as fruit, cars 1.5 tons, containers 7 tons, cereals 12 tons, and crude oil 47 tons. The “Rotterdam Rules” are more recent (2009) 
and relate to common practices to ensure the transport of freight “door-to-door” with a sea transport leg.

# 6.3 Port terminals
Ports are harbor areas in which marine terminal facilities are transferring cargo and passengers between ships and land transportation.

# 1. Ports and Port sites
Ports are points of convergence between the land and maritime domains of passengers and freight circulation. While the maritime domain can involve 
substantial geographic coverage related to global trade, the land domain is related to the region and locality of ports.
Historically, ports emerged as safe harbors for fishing, and those with convenient locations became trade hubs, many of which of free access and 
designed to protect trade.
Today, many of the most important cities in the world owe their origin to their port location. The port is a multidimensional entity anchored within 
geography by its site and situation and depending on its operations, governance structure, and the supply chains it is embedded in.

Due to the operational characteristics of maritime transportation, port location is constrained to a limited array of sites, primarily defined by 
geography. Since ports are bound by the need to serve ships, access to navigable waterways has been historically the most important site consideration.
Port sites were frequently chosen at the head of water navigation, the most upstream sites, such as London on the Thames, Montreal on the St. Lawrence 
River, or Guangzhou on the Pearl River.

Conventional break-bulk terminals were mainly focused on direct transshipment from the deepsea vessel to inland transport modes. Direct transshipment 
is associated with short dwell times, the average time the cargo remains stacked on the terminal and waits for some activity to occur. This required 
only a small temporary storage area on the terminal. 

The growth of the oil industry in the 1920s and 1930s and the fast rise of the chemical industry in the 1950s and 1960s, such as producing 
petrochemicals such as plastics, led many ports to expand to locations with ample space for the development of vast Maritime Industrial Development 
Areas (MIDA). In the 1960s, the gradual shift from conventional break-bulk terminals to container terminals brought about a fundamental change in the 
layout of terminals as well as site selection. Ports increasingly became impacted by global processes, such as sourcing resources, parts, and goods to 
other parts of the world. 

Containerized transportation substantially changed port dynamics to favor the emergence of specialized container ports. Compared to conventional 
break-bulk cargo ships, most containerships did not have onboard cranes, and container terminal facilities had to provide capital-intensive cranes and 
ample storage space to stack containers dockside. 

The usual dwell time of a containership is around 24 hours, implying that a containership spends about ten times less in a port than an equivalent 
break-bulk cargo ship. Containerization has become a fundamental function of global port operations and has changed the structure and configuration of 
port terminals that occupy more space. Recently, ports have been challenged to find enough space to create new large-scale logistics zones in the 
framework of port-centric logistics and free trade and economic development zones.

As terminals, ports handle the largest amounts of freight, more than any other type of terminal combined. For handling freight, port infrastructures 
must jointly accommodate transshipment activities and thus facilitate convergence between land transport and maritime systems. 

Most ports, especially those that are ancient, owe their initial emergence to their site as most harbors take advantage of a natural coastline or a 
natural site along a river.

# 2. Port Functions and traffic
Ports are defined by their traffic since it is their primary function to supply services to freight (warehousing, transshipment, etc.) and ships 
(piers, refueling, repairs, etc.). Consequently, it is misleading to strictly consider a port as a maritime terminal since it acts concomitantly as a 
land terminal where inland traffic originates or ends. Ports are cargo-oriented facilities involving a wide array of activities related to their 
management and operations. The cargo base of a port can expand through the intensification of its fundamental hinterland, the expansion of its 
hinterland to new areas, and the development of transshipment.

Ports are becoming increasingly regional in their dynamics, representing a new development from their traditional local function, namely as industrial 
clusters. For instance, the port of Hong Kong owes its wealth to its natural site and its geographical position as a transit harbor for southern China. 
Shanghai assumes a similar function serving central China through the Yangtze River system. For its part, Singapore has been favored by its location at 
the outlet of the strategic Strait of Malacca and is, therefore, a point of convergence of Southeast Asian transportation. More than 90% of the traffic 
it handles is strictly transshipments, which involve cargo moving from one maritime service to another without exiting the port terminal. New York has 
traditionally acted as the gateway of the North American Midwest through the Hudson / Erie Canal system, a function that Western European ports such as 
Rotterdam or Antwerp perform with access to the Rhine system.

Comparing ports on a tonnage basis requires caution as it does not indicate the nature and value of the cargo. For instance, a mineral port (e.g. iron 
ore), an energy port (e.g. coal or oil), and a container port could handle a similar tonnage but significantly different value levels.

They will also be related to different supply chains as bulk ports are separate entities from container ports. Regarding the freight they handle, ports 
can be classified into monofunctional and polyfunctional ports.

 - Monofunctional ports (resource ports) transit a limited array of commodities, most often dry or liquid bulks (raw materials). They have specialized 
 piers designed to handle specific commodities and where the flows a commonly outbound, implying that they are usually load centers.
 - Polyfunctional ports are vast harbors where transshipment and industrial activities are present. They have a variety of specialized and general 
 cargo piers linked to a wide range of modes that can include containers, bulk cargo, or raw materials. They tend to be more inbound-related facilities.

The oil ports of the Persian Gulf or the mineral ports of Australia, Africa, and, in some measure, Canada are monofunctional.

About 3,700 commercial ports operate worldwide, but only less than one hundred ports can be considered gateways or hubs of global importance. Of this, 
there are about 680 container ports, with 150 handling traffic above a million TEU. Maritime traffic has a high concentration of port activity, a 
process mainly attributed to maritime access and infrastructure development. Major ports have established themselves as gateways of continental 
distribution systems and have access to high-capacity inland freight distribution corridors, notably rail. Such a position is difficult to challenge 
unless a port faces acute congestion, forcing maritime shipping companies to seek alternatives. Gateways, as locations of high accessibility to 
maritime and inland transportation networks, have seen the development of port-centric logistics activities that support export and import-based 
activities.

The world container throughput is the summation of all containers handled by ports, either as imports, exports, or transshipments. As of 2022, about 
866 million TEUs were handled by container ports, including the notable growth in containers transshipped at intermediate locations, as well as the 
repositioning of empty containers. This means that a container is at least counted twice. First, as an import and export, and second, each time it is 
handled at an intermediary location, such as at a transshipment hub, where it will be counted when unloaded and reloaded. Empty containers, most of 
them being repositioned, account for about 20% of the world’s throughput. Thus, throughput should ideally be counted in container moves, but both port 
authorities and terminal operators prefer to communicate throughput figures in TEU for commercial and strategic reasons. The world container traffic is 
the absolute number of containers being carried by sea, excluding the double counts of imports and exports as well as the number of involved 
transshipments. The throughput reflects the level of transport activity (handles and rehandles subject to revenue), while the traffic reflects the 
level of trade activity (imports and exports).

# 3. Port Authorities and Port Holdings
 - Port Authority. An entity of state or local government that owns, operates, or otherwise provides wharf, dock, and other marine terminal investments 
 and services at ports.

 - Port holding. An entity, commonly private, that owns or leases port terminals in a variety of locations. It is also known as a port terminal 
 operator.

 - A concession agreement is a long-term lease of port facilities involving the requirement that the concessionaire undertakes capital investments to 
 build, expand, or maintain the cargo-handling facilities, equipment, and infrastructure to agreed-upon standards.

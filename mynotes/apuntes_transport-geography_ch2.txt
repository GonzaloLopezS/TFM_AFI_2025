# 2.1 The geography of transportation networks
Routes linking locations. Analogy: Structure + flows.
The rooute (link between two nodes, edges) is less tangible in sea corridors.

"The setting of networks results from strategies such as providing access and mobility to a region, reinforcing a specific trade corridor or
 technological developments, and making a particular mode and network more advantageous."

 Transport networks are better understood by the usage level (e.g. the number of passengers, tons, vehicles, capacity) than by their sole 
 topology based on a binary state (presence or absence of links). Inequalities between locations can often be measured by the number of links 
 between nodes and the related economic opportunities associated with connectivity and the level of traffic. Many locations within a network 
 have higher accessibility, which is often related to better opportunities. However, economic integration processes tend to change inequalities
  between regions, mainly by reorientating the structure and flows within transportation networks at the transnational level. Economic and 
  commercial changes are associated with changes in network configurations and connectivity.

Maritime network remains vaguely defined due to its high spatial flexibility.

# 2.2 Transportation and Spatial Organization

## 1. The Spatial Organization of Transportation:
"Transportation favors not only economic development but also has an impact on spatial organization. Throughout history, transport networks 
have structured space at different scales."
 The structure of these flows in terms of origin, destination, and routing are closely related to spatial organization. Space shapes transport
 as much as transport shapes space, which is a salient example of the reciprocity of transportation and its geography. 

## 2. Global Spatial Organization
Maritime Transport benefits from Globalization and supports most of global flows because of its scale of service.

The global spatial organization is a priori conditioned by its connectivity, often reflective of a network structure. Its main components are 
the nodes and the foreland (international connectivity, usually by maritime and air transportation) and hinterlands (regional connectivity, 
usually by land transport systems).

# 2.3 Transport and Location
Location theories tend to have an explicit or implicit role attributed to transport since accessibility is an important factor in the location 
preferences of firms and individuals. As there are no absolute rules dictating locational choices, the importance of transport can only be 
evaluated with varying degrees of accuracy and based on the context it takes place. Transportation has four main locational influences, 
including costs, agglomeration, density, and co-location. At best, the following observations concerning transportation modes and terminals 
and their importance as locations can be made:

Ports and airports. Main port and airport facilities, particularly the networks they support, have been important factors in reducing 
transportation costs, particularly over long distances. The location and the level of activity of ports and airports are reflective of global 
trade patterns. These facilities are also important drivers of co-location of related activities, particularly for ports, since inland 
distribution costs tend to be higher.

"the relationships between transportation and location are dynamic, meaning that circumstances can change due to economic and even political 
factors."

# 2.4 Information Technologies and Mobility

With the emergence of an information society, the transactional structures of the economy have changed drastically towards networked 
organizational forms of individuals, institutions, organizations, and corporations with more intensive interactions, many of which are 
associated with new forms of mobility. Mobility can be provided in three major forms:

    Modal-oriented. The direct ownership and operation of modes and terminals by corporations (owning a fleet) or individuals (owning a 
    vehicle for exclusive use). Ownership guarantees access to mobility at any time. Digitalization involves more efficient internal use of 
    the assets such as tracking and navigation. Still, the optimal use is bounded by the ownership setting.

    Operation-oriented. The direct lease and operation of modes and terminals by corporations and individuals. Leasing guarantees access to 
    mobility for the terms of the lease, such as time and condition. Digitalization involves making assets available across a market, 
    reconciling supply and demand.

    Demand-oriented. Accessing mobility based on expected demand (for corporations) and need (for individuals). Digitalization involves 
    accessing the availability of transportation assets in real time to rent their use temporarily.

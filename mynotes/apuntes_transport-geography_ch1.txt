Chapter 1:

Nos centramos en lo que se refiere a la introducción del contenedor y el concepto "container shipping" a lo largo del siglo XX (Globalización).
La "geografía del transporte" concierne a la movilidad de las personas, organización espacial... Incluye atributos relacionados con el origen, destino,
naturaleza y propósito de la movilidad. 

purpose of transportation is to overcome space, which is shaped by human and physical constraints such as distance, time, administrative divisions,
 and topography

 From the mobility of a person using an automobile or a public transit system to commute to their place of work to the mobility of cargo being shipped
  across the Pacific as part of an international trade transaction; both are bound to a similar set of constraints.

1.3 Historia de la mecanizacion de los transportes y el comercio:
https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter1/emergence-of-mechanized-transportation-systems/
"Puedo usar un resumen del siguiente texto como introducción":
The economic importance and the geopolitics of transportation were recognized very early. 
Maritime transportation was the most convenient way to move freight and passengers around, an advantage that would not change until
the Industrial Revolution. Large commercial empires were established with the setting of maritime trade networks. However, long-distance 
maritime trade involved risk, which favored the emergence of a financing and insurance industry as mitigation instruments. In Ancient Greece, 
merchants financed their commercial ventures through high-interest loans that acted simultaneously as insurance since the loan would not be repaid 
if the ship sank. This model, known as “bottomry”, was then copied by the Romans. It originates in the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi around 1700 BCE 
stating repayment of a loan for a successful voyage. These early forms of financing and insurance permitted commercial activities that would otherwise
 not have taken place to the same extent.

By the 13th century, an extensive maritime trade network was established, the highways of the time, centered along the navigable rivers, 
canals, and coastal waters of Europe and China. Shipping was using the English Channel, the North Sea, the Baltic, and the Mediterranean, 
where the most important cities were coastal or inland ports (London, Norwich, Königsberg, Hamburg, Bruges, Bordeaux, Lyon, Lisbon, Barcelona, 
and Venice). Trade of bulk goods, such as grain, salt, wine, wool, timber, and stone, took place. By the 14th century, galleys were finally replaced 
by full-fledged sailships (the caravel, the carrick, and then the galleon) that were faster and required smaller crews. The discovery by the Portuguese
 in 1431 of the North Atlantic circular wind pattern, better known as the trade winds, marked the beginning of European expansion. A similar wind 
 pattern was also found in the Indian and Pacific oceans with the monsoon winds. This allowed sailships to travel over longer distances along 
 consistent and reliable routes.

 [...]

 The beginning of the 19th century saw the establishment of the first regular maritime routes linking harbors worldwide, 
 especially over the North Atlantic between Europe and North America. Many of these long-distance routes were navigated by fast Clipper ships, 
 which dominated ocean trade until the late 1850s. Due to technical improvements such as hull design, copper plating (less drag), 
 improved sail designs, and iron joints and bolts, the speed of sailships increased by a factor of up to 50% between 1750 and 1830. 
 By the 1850s, it could take more than three months to move cargo from China to the UK, while before clipper ships, the same journey 
 could take up to one year. Another significant improvement was the design of accurate navigation charts where prevailing winds and sea currents 
 could be used for navigation advantages. Composite ships (a mix of wood and iron armature) then took over a large portion of the trade 
 until about 1900. Still, they could not compete with steamships, which have been continually improved since they were first introduced 
 one hundred years before.

1. Transporte en la era fordista:
2. (1970-2000 Era Post-Fordista)

The diffusion of railways in the late 19th and early 20th centuries considerably improved the efficiency of inland transportation. However, the growth
 of trade and the economies of scale provided by railways placed additional pressures on ports where the interface between maritime and inland 
 transport systems was the bottleneck. Containers were introduced by the American entrepreneur Malcolm McLean, who initially applied containerization 
 to land transport but saw the opportunity to use container shipping as an alternative to acute road congestion in the early 1950s before the first 
 Interstate Highways were constructed. The first containership (the Ideal-X, a converted T2 oil tanker) set sail in 1956 from New York to Houston and 
 marked the beginning of the era of containerization.

Before the introduction of containers, loading and unloading at ports could account for between 50% and 70% of the cost of break bulk shipping. 
Containers, the main agents of the modern international transport system, enable increased freight transport flexibility, mainly by reducing 
transshipment costs and delays; handling a container requires about 25 to 40 times less labor than its equivalent in bulk freight. Loading and 
unloading operations that required days could now be done in a matter of hours. The first containerships spent about 18% of their operational time at 
ports, while a breakbulk ship would spend 40%. From a cost perspective, loading and unloading cargo went from about $5 per ton for breakbulk cargo to 
about 15 cents per ton with containers. This enabled further the unitization trend brought forward by the pallet, particularly since pallets could be 
loaded into containers. The initial attempts at containerization thus aimed at reducing maritime transshipment costs and time. Later on, the true 
potential of containerization became clear when interfacing with other modes became an operational reality, mainly between maritime, rail, and road 
transportation.

In 1960, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, foreseeing the potential of containerization, constructed the first specialized container 
terminal next to Port Newark; the Port Elizabeth Marine Terminal. Unlike conventional break bulk operations that require storage sheds adjacent to 
piers, containerization requires large paved open spaces for container storage. The Sea-Land Company established the first regular maritime container 
line in 1966 over the Atlantic between North America and Western Europe. It took over a decade for the container to become a standardized form of 
maritime shipping as ports and shipping lines were initially reluctant to provide the required capital investments. By the early 1980s, container 
services with specialized ships (cellular containerships, first introduced in 1968) became a dominant aspect of international and regional transport 
systems, transforming the maritime industry. However, the size of those ships remained constrained for 20 years by the size of the Panama Canal, which
 de facto became the Panamax standard. In 1988, the first post-Panamax containership was introduced, indicating the will to expand economies of scale 
 in maritime container shipping. The container revolution was concomitant with globalization by supporting an increasingly complex system of trade 
 involving parts, manufactured goods, and even commodities. Few other transport innovations had such an impact on the global economic landscape.

3. Setting of Global Mobility Systems:
 By the second half of the 20th century, trade liberalization and the formation of economic blocs allowed for the fragmentation of production at the 
 global level. A conjunction of trade liberalization, containerization, and technological innovations modified the operational scale of transport 
 systems and their network structure. The setting of gateways and hubs became particularly prevalent, leading to an extended scale for transportation 
 that reflects commercial considerations less subject to political or regulatory constraints. 

 The increasing efforts to manage freight reinforced the development of logistics and global supply chains.
 Although manufacturing clusters emerged in the first half of the 20th century, by the 21st century, clusters became prevalent across a wide range of 
 activities and locations. Accessibility and connectivity offered by intermodal transportation allowed for setting logistics clusters near terminal 
 facilities. These clusters became the regulators and coordinators of distribution systems spanning large regions.

1.5 Transporte y Geografía Comercial:
https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter1/transportation-and-commercial-geography/
1. Comercio y geografía comercial:
Trade, the exchange of goods and services over long distances, and commercial activities, the exchange of products and services at specific markets, 
are core components of the economy. Trade and commerce have evolved in space and time, from low volume and limited extent before the industrial 
revolution, to the extensive flows and transactions that characterize the contemporary global economy. 

Trade is the transmission of ownership in return for a counterpart, generally money, often defined as a medium of exchange. This exchange involves 
a transaction and its associated capital flows, information, commodities, parts, or finished products. All these activities define commercial geography.

La geografía comercial investiga las características espaciales del comercio y las transacciones en términos de su naturaleza, causas y consecuencias.

Commercial geography can be considered a component of economic geography similar to transport geography. Still, it is relevant to see commercial 
geography as distinct, which allows the sphere of locations investigated by economic geography to interact with the sphere of circulation investigated 
by transport geography.

# 5. Transportation Modes
are essential components of transport systems since they are the means of supporting mobility. Modes can be grouped into three broad categories based 
on the medium they exploit: land, water, and air. 

Maritime Transportation:
With physical properties such as buoyancy and limited friction, maritime transportation is the most effective mode of moving large quantities of cargo 
over long distances. Main maritime routes are composed of oceans, coasts, seas, lakes, rivers, and channels. However, due to the location of economic 
activities, maritime circulation takes place in specific parts of the maritime space, particularly over the North Atlantic and the North Pacific.

Yet, with containerization, maritime shipping has become the linchpin of globalization, allowing the trading of a wide range of goods and commodities.

Intermodal transportation:
Although intermodal transportation applies to passenger movements, such as using the different, interconnected modes of a public transit system, it is 
over freight transportation that the most significant impacts of intermodalism have been observed. Containerization has been a powerful vector of 
intermodal integration, enabling maritime and land transportation systems to interconnect.

2. Modal Competition:
Modes can compete or complement one another in cost, speed, accessibility, frequency, safety, comfort, etc. 
Three main conditions ensure that some modes complement one another:
- Different geographical markets. If different markets are involved, modes will enable continuity within the transport system, particularly if 
different scales are concerned, such as between national and international transportation. This requires an interconnection, commonly known as a 
gateway, where transferring from one mode to another is possible. 
- Different transport markets. The nature of what is being transported, such as passengers or freight, often indicates a level of complementarity. 
Even if the same market area is serviced, it may not be equally accessible, depending on the mode used. 
- Different levels of service. For a similar market and accessibility, two modes offering different service levels will tend to complement one another 
with niche services.

While maritime transport might offer the lowest variable costs, road transport tends to be most competitive over short distances and for small bundles 
of goods. A critical factor is the terminal cost structure for each mode, where the costs (and delays) of loading and unloading a unit impose fixed 
costs incurred independent of the distance traveled.

With increasing income levels, the propensity for people to travel rises. At the same time, international trade in manufactured goods and parts has 
increased. These trends in travel demand act differently upon modes. Freight, rail, and shipping have been impacted by competition from road and air 
modes. While shipping, pipelines, and rail still perform well for bulk shipments, competition has seen road and air modes capture an important market 
share of the high revenue-generating goods over the last decades.

- Infrastructure usage. Competition resulting from the presence of freight and passenger traffic on the same itineraries linking the same nodes. 
Therefore, each level of capacity a mode uses is at the expense of the other mode.
- Market area. Competition between transport terminals for using new locations (terminal relocation or expansion) or capturing new markets (hinterland).

# 5.4 Maritime Transportation
From its modest origins as Egyptian coastal and river sailships around 3,200 BCE, maritime transportation has always been the dominant support of 
global trade. By 1,200 BCE, Egyptian ships traded as far as Sumatra, representing one of the longest maritime routes of that time. By the 10th century, 
Chinese merchants frequented the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, establishing regional trade networks.

With the development of the steam engine in the mid-19th century, trade networks expanded considerably as ships were no longer subject to dominant wind 
patterns. Accordingly, and in conjunction with the opening of the Suez Canal, the second half of the 19th century saw an intensification of maritime 
trade to and across the Pacific. In the 20th century, maritime transport grew exponentially as changes in international trade and seaborne trade became 
interrelated. Maritime transportation, like all transportation, is a derived demand that exists to support trade relations, which are influenced by the 
existing maritime shipping capacity and the changes in the composition of maritime shipping services. 

There is a level of reciprocity between trade and maritime shipping capabilities. As of 2018, seaborne trade accounted for 80% of global trade in 
volume and 70% in value. Maritime shipping is one of the most globalized industries in ownership and operations.

Maritime transportation, like land and air modes, operates on its own space, which is concomitantly geographical by its physical attributes, strategic 
by its control, and commercial by its usage. While geographical considerations tend to be constant in time (except for the seasonality of weather 
patterns), strategic and especially commercial considerations are much more dynamic. The physiography of maritime transportation is composed of two 
major elements, which are rivers and oceans.

The notion of maritime transportation rests on the existence of regular itineraries, better known as maritime routes.

Maritime routes. Corridors trying to avoid the discontinuities of land transport by linking ports. Maritime routes are a function of obligatory points 
of passage, physical constraints (coasts, winds, marine currents, depth, reefs, ice), and political borders. Maritime routes draw arcs on the ocean 
surface as they try to follow the great circle distance.

The most recent technological transformations affecting water transport have focused on modifying water channels, such as dredging port channels to 
deeper depths and expanding the capacity of transoceanic passages such as Panama and Suez. Increasing the size, automation, and specialization of vessels 
(e.g. container ships, tankers, bulk carriers) has also been the focus. This has required the development of massive port terminal facilities to 
support the technical requirements of maritime transportation.

The growing importance of container shipping is also associated with risks related to the immobilization of ship assets.

Most maritime circulation occurs along coastlines, and two continents have limited fluvial trade; Africa and Australia.
For instance, France has significant nautical accessibility, but the primary port handling containerized traffic is Antwerp in Belgium.

The importance and configuration of maritime routes have changed with economic development and technical improvements. Among those, containerization 
changed the configuration of freight routes with innovative services. Before containerization, loading or unloading a ship was a costly and 
time-consuming task, and a cargo ship typically spent more time docked than at sea. While sailing time represented around 25% of the annual ship time 
for standard break-bulk ships, this figure is now around 70% for containerships. With faster and cheaper port operations, inter-range routes have 
emerged as a dominant configuration of containerized maritime networks.

- Inter-range service. Involves a set of sequential port calls from at least two maritime ranges, commonly including a transoceanic service and 
structured as a continuous loop. They are almost exclusively used for container transportation with the purpose of servicing a market by balancing the 
number of port calls and the frequency of services.

The main advantage of inter-range services is the ability to call several ports and increase the ship load factor. This sequence of ports tends to be 
highly flexible in terms of which ports are serviced to maximize the market potential.

## 2. Maritime traffic
Maritime transportation is dominantly focused on freight since there is no other effective alternative to the long-distance transportation of large 
amounts of freight. The systematic growth of maritime freight traffic has been fueled by the following:
- Absolute advantages. They are linked with the geographical distribution of resources, implying that the places of extraction usually differ from the 
places of consumption. Therefore, large quantities of cargo need to be carried over long distances.

- Comparative advantages. Concerns cargoes that under ideal circumstances would likely not be carried. Substantial shipping is generated because of cost 
and capabilities differentials. Outsourcing, offshoring, and trade liberalization resulted in parts and finished goods being carried over long 
distances, supporting the growth in container shipping. Due to economic conditions, such cargo can be temporary and subject to changes in their origins 
and destinations.

- Technical improvements. Ships and maritime terminals have become more efficient in terms of their throughput and their ability to handle several 
types of cargoes (e.g. containers, natural gas, refrigerated goods), enabling them to support long-distance trade.

- Economies of scale. The growth in the size of ships permitted maritime transportation to become increasingly cost-effective, a trend that has been 
strengthened by containerization.

Maritime traffic is commonly measured in deadweight tons, which refers to the cargo that can be loaded on an “empty” ship without exceeding its 
operational design limits. This limit is often identified as a loadline, which is the maximal draft of the ship and does not account for the ship’s 
weight but includes fuel and ballast water. Maritime freight is conventionally considered in two main markets:
- Bulk cargo. Refers to freight, both dry and liquid, that is not packaged, such as minerals (oil, coal, iron ore, bauxite) and grains. 
Conventionally, this cargo has a single origin, destination, and client and is prone to economies of scale. Services tend to be irregular, except for 
energy trades, and part of vertically integrated production processes. The dynamics of the bulk market are mainly attributed to industrialization and 
economic development, creating additional demand for resources and energy.

- Break-bulk cargo. Refers to general cargo that has been packaged in some way with the use of bags, boxes, drums, and particularly containers. This 
cargo tends to have numerous origins, destinations, and clients. Before containerization, economies of scale were difficult to achieve with break-bulk 
cargo as loading and unloading were very labor and time-consuming. The dynamics of the breakbulk market are related to manufacturing and consumption.

The composition of maritime traffic has shifted from being dominated by liquid bulk (petroleum) to dry bulk and containers. Technical improvements 
tend to blur the distinction between bulk and break-bulk cargo, as both can be unitized on pallets and increasingly in containers.
The amount of containerized freight has grown substantially, from 9.8% of total tons-km in 2000 to 15.2% in 2021.

Geographically, maritime traffic has evolved considerably over the last decades, especially through growth in Asia-Europe and transpacific trade. By 
establishing commercial linkages between continents, maritime transport supports considerable traffic. The advantage of maritime transport does not 
rest on its speed, but on its capacity and on the continuity of its services. 

The global maritime shipping industry is serviced by about 55,000 registered commercial vessels of more than 1,000 tons.

## 3. Maritime shipping
The maritime shipping industry is one of the most globalized.

Maritime shipping is dominated by bulk cargo, with dry bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal, and grain roughly accounting for 28% of all the ton-miles 
shipped in 2021. Due to containerization, the share of break-bulk cargo is increasing steadily, which accounted for 15% of all ton-miles in 2021. 
Maritime shipping has traditionally faced two drawbacks in relation to other modes. First, it is slow, with speeds at sea averaging 15 knots for bulk 
ships (26 km/hr), although container ships are designed to sail at speeds above 20 knots (37 km/hr). Secondly, delays are encountered in ports where 
loading and unloading take place. The latter may involve several days of handling when break-bulk cargo is concerned. These drawbacks are particularly 
constrained where goods must be moved over short distances or shippers require rapid deliveries.

Maritime shipping has seen several major technical innovations aiming at improving the performance of ships or their access to port facilities, 
notably in the 20th century. 

### a. Ship size and speed:
Each time the size of a ship is doubled, its capacity is cubed (tripled). Although the minimum size for cost-effective bulk handling is estimated to 
be around 1,000 deadweight tons, economies of scale have pushed for larger ship sizes to service transportation demand.

The largest tankers (ULCC) are around 500,000 dwt (dominant size between 250,000 and 350,000 dwt), while the largest dry bulk carriers are around 
350,000 dwt (dominant size between 100,000 and 150,000 dwt). For container shipping, the scale effect on ships has been an important driving force in 
the growth of its capacity. 

The average speed of ships is about 15 knots (1 knot = 1 marine mile = 1,853 meters), which is 28 km per hour. Under such circumstances, a ship would 
travel about 575 km per day. More recent ships can travel between 25 to 30 knots (45 to 55 km per hour), but it is uncommon for a commercial ship to 
travel faster than 25 knots due to energy requirements. 

### b. Ship specialization and design
Economies of scale are often linked with market specialization and segmentation since many ships are designed to carry only one type of cargo. In 
maritime transportation, ships have a commercial openness in terms of the diversity of customers they can serve and a functional openness in terms of 
the diversity of cargo they can carry.

ships became increasingly specialized, including general cargo ships, tankers, grain carriers, barges, mineral carriers, bulk carriers, Liquefied 
Natural Gas (LNG) carriers, RO-RO ships (roll-on roll-off; for vehicles), and container ships.

Ship design significantly improved from wood hulls (before the 16th century) to wood hulls with steel armatures (18th century), to steel hulls (19th 
century; the first were warships), and to steel, aluminum, and composite materials hulls in the 20th and 21st centuries. The hulls of contemporary 
ships result from considerable efforts to minimize energy consumption and construction costs and improve safety. 

Different automation technologies are possible, including self-unloading ships, computer-assisted navigation (crew needs are reduced, and safety is 
increased), global positioning systems, and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). Automation has resulted in smaller crews being required to operate 
larger ships.

# 5.6 Intermodal Transportation and Containerization
ntermodal transportation concerns the mobility of passengers or freight from an origin to a destination relying on several modes of transportation. 
The container has become the dominant intermodal transport unit.

## 3. Containerization
Container. A large standard size metal box into which cargo is packed for shipment aboard specially configured transport modes (ISO 668). It is 
designed to be moved with common handling equipment enabling high-speed intermodal transfers in economically large units between ships, railcars, 
truck chassis, and barges using a minimum of labor. The container, therefore, serves as the load unit rather than the cargo contained therein. The 
reference size is the 20-foot box of 20 feet long, 8’6″ feet high and 8 feet wide, or 1 Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU). Since most containers are 
now forty feet long, the term Forty-foot Equivalent Unit (FEU) is also used, but less commonly. “Hi cube” containers are also common, and they are one 
foot higher (9’6″) than the standard.

Containerization. Refers to the increasing and generalized use of the container as a load unit for freight transportation. It involves processes where 
the intermodal container either substitutes cargo from other conveyances, is adopted as a mode supporting freight distribution, or can diffuse 
spatially as a growing number of transport systems are able to handle containers.

Containerization conveys a variety of benefits to the mobility of freight, namely lower transportation costs, lower inventory costs, and a higher 
service level, including reliability.

## 4. Advantages and Challenges of Containerization:
a. Standardization
b. Flexibility of usage
c. Economies of scale
d. Operational Velocity
e. Warehousing and security
f. Site constraints
Containerization implies a large consumption of terminal space. To fully load or unload a containership of 5,000 TEU, a minimum of 12 hectares of 
stacking space is required. Conventional port areas are often inadequate for the location of container transshipment infrastructures, particularly 
because of draft issues as well as required space for terminal operations. Many container vessels require a draft of at least 14 meters (45 feet), and 
the later generation of larger ships requires at least 15 meters (50 feet). The site constraints imposed by containerization have incited the 
development of new terminal facilities and migration towards better-suited sites. A similar challenge applies to container rail terminals; many were 
relocated at the periphery of metropolitan areas. Consequently, major container handling facilities have new location criteria where suitable sites are 
only found at the periphery and, at times, far from the original site.

g. Infrastructure costs and stacking
h. Thefts and losses
i. Empty travel
j. Illicit trade
By its confidential character, the container is a common instrument used in the illicit trade of counterfeit goods, drugs, and weapons. At the global 
level, only 2 to 5% of all containers handled at ports are manually inspected by customs, leaving opportunities for illicit cargoes. This share can go 
as low as 1% for several large European ports. Manually inspecting a container requires physical resources such as inspection areas as well as labor 
resources. Thus, assessing if a container should be physically inspected is the outcome of careful considerations related to its origin, the customs 
declaration, the carrier, and the cargo owner. Concerns have also been raised about containers being used for terrorism.

These fears have given rise to regulations to counter the illegal use of containers. In 2003, following US inspection requirements, the International 
Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced regulations regarding the security of port sites and the vetting of workers in the shipping industry. The 
United States established a 24-hour rule, requiring all shipments destined for the United States to receive clearance from US authorities 24 hours 
before the vessel’s departure. In 2008, the US Congress passed a regulation requiring all US-bound containers to be electronically scanned at the 
foreign loading port before departure. These measures incur additional costs and delays that many in the industry oppose.

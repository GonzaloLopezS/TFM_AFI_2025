Staffordshire's drug seizure data was incomplete, and hence although they supplied some data, we had to exclude it from the 2020/21 figures.  Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Unnamed: 24,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Class B,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Cocaine,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Ecstasy,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Ecstasy,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Methadone,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Morphine,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Cannabis,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Barbiturates,,,,,,,,,,

Staffordshire's drug seizure data was incomplete, and hence although they supplied some data, we had to exclude it from the 2020/21 figures.  Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Ketamine,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Mephedrone,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Benzodiazepines,,,,,,,,,,

Imputation methods have been used to estimate the drug seizures figures for that year, for these police forces. ",2021,Nitrous Oxide,,,,,,,,,,
